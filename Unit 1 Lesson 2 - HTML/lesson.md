## Introduction to Websites

We've all experienced the wonder of websites, haven't we? Think about your favorite platform, like YouTube (www.youtube.com), where you can find a vast array of content to suit your interests. Websites are like digital destinations accessible through computers or devices. They provide a gateway to a wide range of information, entertainment, education, and much more.

## The Magic of HTML

Now, let's dive into the exciting world of website creation. How do these digital wonders come to life? Well, you can't build them with physical building blocks like Legos or clay. Instead, websites are crafted using the power of computers, and the magic behind this process lies in a tool called HTML.

HTML, which stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language," is the backbone of all websites on the internet. It serves as the language used to structure web pages, allowing you to present content in a meaningful way. Don't worry about remembering the full form; you can call it "HTML" for simplicity.

## Understanding HTML Tags

To create a website with HTML, you need to familiarize yourself with HTML tags. These tags are like instructions that tell the computer how to structure and display the content on your web page. HTML tags come in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag, encapsulating the content in between.

For example, the paragraph tag is used to add text to your website. However, in the given example, the paragraph tag is not displaying correctly. To fix this, we can use the PRE (preformatted) tag, which preserves the formatting and displays the content as it is:
<pre>
  <p>This is a paragraph tag. It adds words to your website.</p>
</pre>
In addition to paragraphs, you can use the image tag to add pictures to your website:
<img src="your-image-file.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

These are just a few examples of HTML tags. There are numerous other tags, each serving a specific purpose, waiting for you to explore and learn.

## Bringing Your Website to Life

Building a website might seem daunting, but fear not! Your computer will do most of the heavy lifting. Your role is to provide instructions through HTML tags, guiding the computer in creating your desired website.

To get started, you should have a plan. Grab a sheet of paper and unleash your creativity by sketching how you envision your website. Consider the layout, colors, content, and any other elements you wish to include.

Once you have a blueprint, you can begin transforming it into reality using HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is another essential tool that complements HTML, allowing you to control the design and layout of your web page.
