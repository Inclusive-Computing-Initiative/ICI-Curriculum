# Formatting Guidelines

## File naming/storage

+ Every Lesson should be assigned it's own folder, with any other extra files(Like Images and such) also inside.

+ The folder should be named **unit#lesson#** - where the first hashtag repersents the number of the unit and the second the name of the lesson.

+ The markdown file inside of the folder should be named **unit#lesson#.md** - where the first hashtag repersents the number of the unit and the second the name of the lesson.

+ Extra files have no naming guidelines.

## Writing Guidelines

+ The unit number and lesson number along side with the name of the lesson should all be at the top of the page and at heading size #1, with a hyphen separating the two. Ex. Unit 1 Lesson 1 - Intro to Course

+ All other subheadings should be at heading size #2

+ The use of AI tools is prohibited to write the material for the curriculum
