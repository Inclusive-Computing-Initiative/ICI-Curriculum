# Unit 2 Lesson 1 Introduction

## Scratch

In the last unit, we learned about web development and used HTML and CSS to build your very own website. In this unit, you will create your very own program!

Now we know that those long lines of confusing code can look intimidating at first, but don't worry! We will start off with something a little easier, and eventually, you will be able to create your very own programs!

Let's start off with understanding what Scratch is. Scratch is a coding community by MIT that builds the foundation of coding for aspiring beginners. In another words, Scratch is a great place to start your coding journey. In order to start though, we first need to create an account.

### Registering an Account

To create an account, visit this website:

> https://scratch.mit.edu/join

Follow the instructions by entering a fun name (keep in mind that the world can see this name, so do not include personal information) and a strong password. Make sure that you are able to remember both your username and password because you need to enter this information every time you want to use Scratch. After you have done this, hit "Next".

On the next screen, click the square that says "Select country" and select United States of America. Then click the next button.

Next, enter the month and year that you were born and click the next button.

After clicking next, select your gender and click the next button.

After that, enter an email address that you have access to. This can either be your email or a parent's email. Just in case you forget your password or any other nessicarry information, entering an accessible email will allow you to retrieve this information. After you have entered your email, click "Create Your Account".

In a couple minutes, the you entered email should have recieved an email about activating your account. If you entered your parent's email, kindly ask them to do so.

Congratulations!!! ðŸŽ‰You have now created an account.

### Logging In

Registering should automatically log you into your Scratch account, but if you ever need to log in, visit this website:

> https://scratch.mit.edu/

After you have done so, click "Sign In" at the top right and enter the username and password that you registered with.

### Your Account

Congratulations on starting your journey! Try exploring the Scratch website. You can look around, or explore other people's projects, and much more. In this lesson, we created your very own Scratch account! In the next lesson, you will start your very own project!
