# Unit 2 Lesson 8: Next Steps

Congratulations! You've made it! ðŸŽ‰

Believe it or not, you've picked up some extremely important topics in computer science. You also practiced some higher level techniques that you will use in the future. Let's go over some things that you've learned.

- Variables: stores data that can be changed or utilized by other parts of the program
- Conditionals: runs different blocks of code depending on the value of an expression (true or false)
- Loops: repeats a block of code a given amount of times or until a condition is met
- Functions: a way to group together code for repetition with changing values.
- Calls: a trigger that instructs a different part of the program to perform an action

With all of these topics, you are ready to start programming on your own. We've already made the pong game, but that's not all. You can try to make a game/program on your own or improve the game that we've made together.

Here are some ways you can improve the Scratch game:
- use delays to delay a ball's movement
- hide the ball and paddle after the game is over
- add your own unique twist to the game

You are able to use these basic ideas to build some wonderful projects. The only limit is your imagination! Good luck!
